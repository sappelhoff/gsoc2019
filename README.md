# gsoc2019

This repository hosts my [changlog](./changelog.md) file, in which I track my
progress for the Google Summer of Code 2019 with
[MNE-Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python).

You can find my original GSoC proposal [here](https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/media/proposals/appelhoff_gsoc2019.pdf).

The [issues page](https://github.com/sappelhoff/gsoc2019/issues) can be used
for getting in touch and/or discussing plans on what to implement within the
context of GSoC.
