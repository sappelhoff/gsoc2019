# gsoc2019

This repository hosts my [changlog](./changelog.md) file, in which I track my
progress for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019 with the
[Python Software Foundation](https://python-gsoc.org/)
and [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools).

You can find my original GSoC proposal
[here](https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/media/proposals/appelhoff_gsoc2019.pdf).

I am writing a [blog](https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/sappelhoffs-blog/)
during my GSoC.

The [issues page](https://github.com/sappelhoff/gsoc2019/issues) can be used
for getting in touch and/or discussing plans on what to implement within the
context of GSoC.

The `/misc_code` directory contains some scripts that are being referred to in
the changelog.

Lastly, feel free to check out my
[Final Report](https://github.com/sappelhoff/gsoc2019/blob/master/FINAL_REPORT.md).


# Post - GSOC notes

- I had to update one of the datalad repos, see https://neurostars.org/t/datalad-verification-of-content-failed/7003 for issues and solutions
- Future Datalad / OSF integrations should make use of the new Datalad extension: https://github.com/datalad/datalad-osf
